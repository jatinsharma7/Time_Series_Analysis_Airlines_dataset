# Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security or economic variable changes over time. It can also be used to examine how the changes associated with the chosen data point compare to shifts in other variables over the same time period.


# Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting uses information regarding historical values and associated patterns to predict future activity. Most often, this relates to trend analysis, cyclical fluctuation analysis and issues of seasonality. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed.

## Goal
This objective of this analysis and modelling is to review time series theory and experiment with R packages.

We will be following an ARIMA modeling procedure of the AirPassengers dataset as follows:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Decomposition of data
3. Test the stationarity
4. Fit a model used an automated algorithm
5. Calculate forecasts
